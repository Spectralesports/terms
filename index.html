    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Dear Player,</p>
    <p>Congratulations on becoming a part of our esports team! We are thrilled to have you on board and look forward to achieving great heights together. In order to ensure a smooth and successful journey, we have outlined the following regiment for our players:</p>

    <h2>1. Tournament Prizes:</h2>
    <p>When our team secures victory in a tournament, the prize pool will be distributed among the players, and you will receive 79% of the total prize amount. We believe in rewarding our players for their hard work and dedication to the team's success.</p>

    <h2>2. Fixed Salary Based on Performance and Skills:</h2>
    <p>To provide stability and support, we offer a fixed salary to each player based on their performance and skills. This salary will be reviewed regularly to ensure it aligns with your contributions to the team. The better your performance and the more you excel, the higher your salary will be.</p>

    <h2>3. Salary Payout:</h2>
    <p>Your salary will be paid out to you after a period of 9 months, counting from the date you officially joined the team. After this initial period, your salary will be paid every month-end based on your achievements and commitment to the team. This system ensures that you have the time to prove yourself and establish a strong foundation within the organization.</p>

    <h2>4. Prize Pool Disbursement:</h2>
    <p>Unlike the salary payout, the prize pool earned from winning matches or tournaments will be given to you immediately after the victory. We want you to celebrate your achievements and see the rewards of your hard work right away.</p>

    <h2>5. Behavior and Conduct:</h2>
    <p>As an esports team, we maintain high standards of sportsmanship and professionalism. Any form of unwanted behavior, toxicity, or unethical conduct will not be tolerated. We expect all our players to treat their teammates, opponents, and the gaming community with respect. Failure to adhere to these standards may result in your removal from the organization.</p>

    <p>We believe that a strong team is built on mutual trust, respect, and dedication. Together, we can achieve greatness and make a name for ourselves in the esports world. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this regiment or any other matter, please feel free to discuss it with us.</p>

    <p>Welcome aboard, and let's embark on this exciting journey together!</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Vijay v.s<br>
    Owner<br>
    Spectral Esports</p>
